API	Application programming interface. An API is a set of routines,
	protocols, and tools for building software applications.
	If specifies how software should interact with eachother,
	a comming type of API could be a library. You could get the
	Google maps API to integrate maps into your software.

IDE	Integrated development enviroment. This means that it usually got a
	text editor, a compiler of some sorts and a debugger. Most IDE's also
	got a auto complete mode for faster coding. (ex. Eclipse, Visual Studio etc.)

ps	Process Status. This command will show information about the current
	running processes, including the PID number. From here you can find
	a certain process and use "kill <PID>" to terminate the process.
	ex: ps -ef | grep firefox

top	The top command is used to monitor processor activity in real time.
	Personally I use 'htop' because I find it to be more interactive and
	less painful to use.


df	disk free. This command will tell how much disk space you have used and
	how much you got free. At first glance i found that the '-h' (human readable)
	option was pretty usefull.

kill	The kill command is used to send a signal to a process, default is TERM
	wich will terminate the process and "kill" it.


netstat	Network statistics. This is used to statisticly display the connections
	on the network, both in and out. This command is used to find problems
	in the network and determine the amount of traffic.

ifconfig is a system administration utility in Unix-like operating systems 
	to configure, control, and query TCP/IP network interface parameters 
	from a command line interface (CLI) or in system configuration scripts.
	Ifconfig originally appeared in 4.2BSD as part of the BSD TCP/IP suite.

who	This command will display who is using the system. I found that using the
	'last' command will display a list of who has been using the system.
