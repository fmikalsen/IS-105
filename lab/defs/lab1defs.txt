mkdir Creates a new directory in your current directory (ex. mkdir movies)

cd Changes directory (ex. cd /home/dracz/Documents) cd .. will take you to the parent directory

ls This command will list the viewable items in the current directory.

ls -l will do the same as "ls" though it will list them vertically (its for easier viewing I guess)

ls -la This will list all the files including hidden files and present them as a vertical list.

pwd Simply prints the working directory (The directory you're currenty in)

pipes in linux means that we can run a command through another one, eks if I got alot of files in a directory I can use ls -l to list them all. If I want to list only the files containing the filename "lab" I can do "ls -l | grep lab" This will run the ls -l comman through grep who will filter and display only the files containing lab in its filename. It takes the output of the command and place it into another command.

grep is a command for searching in plain text.

cat will print out the text in a file, you can also chose where to display the text (ex. "cat lab1.txt > newfile.txt" This will "display" the text from "lab1.txt" and "display" it in newfile.txt). You could also do "cat > newfile" and then write what you want to be displayed in newfile (exit cat by pressing CTRL+d)
